⚠️ Notice: Development on the RESTasV3 API wrapper has been frozen ⚠️

This repository contains an older version of the CyPerf REST API wrapper, which is no longer actively maintained or updated.
Starting with CyPerf 7.0 release, all new features and improvements are available exclusively in the [new API wrapper](https://github.com/Keysight/cyperf-api-wrapper).
We strongly recommend transitioning to the new version to ensure compatibility with the latest CyPerf capabilities and continued support.
For setup instructions and usage examples, refer to the [README](https://github.com/Keysight/cyperf-api-wrapper/blob/main/README.md) of the new wrapper.

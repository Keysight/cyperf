# Deploying CyPerf in AWS using the Controller Proxy and Agent Pair 
## Introduction
This solution uses a CloudFormation Template to deploy the CyPerf Controller-proxy and two CyPerf Agents in an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud solution.
You can use templates in two ways:
- Using a new VPC template, meaning the entire necessary resources are created from scratch, including VPC, Subnets, Route Table, Internet Gateway, Nat-Gateway and so on.
- Or use an existing VPC template, meaning entire network resources like VPC, Subnets, Route Tables, IGW, Nat-Gateway including Security Groups already exists. You can select an existing VPC, subnet and security group during deployment.

See the **Template Parameters** topic for more details. 

Each agent has two interfaces:
- The Management interface, agents communicate with the Controller-Proxy using this interface
- The Test interface, test traffic flows through it.

During the first deployment, a default Agent is set as the test interface and the management interface is set as the second interface. This means that the deployment test traffic flows only between the first interface of both agents.

After a deployment is successful , the public IP of the controller-proxy EC2 instance is fetched from the AWS console. You can now add this IP to **CyPerf Controller** > **Administration** > **Message Brokers**. 
Cyperf Agents which are registered with controller-proxy will appear in CyPerf controller.

## Template Parameters
The following table lists the parameters for the deployment in a **New VPC**.
